The new thing called \"design\" was born and it rapidly conquered the world. Today design is an inhered part of software development. But can it work the other way around?\n\nIn my talk/research I’m going to proof that applying simple design principles can and will make you a better software engineer. We’re going dig into a brief history of modern product design, figure out what makes design different from art and draw parallels with software development. We will see what makes an open-source library popular and how is design responsible for that.","persons":[{"name":"Алексей","lastname":"Тактаров","photo":{"title":"Тактаров","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/ej3wzulnf8dw/5bOQO8Z4Kg0BK6WYAwmSxv/746ccbeaaf0256c2bccefa057b4ebda4/____________.jpg","details":{"size":4711,"image":{"width":200,"height":200}},"fileName":"Без названия.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"},"id":"5bOQO8Z4Kg0BK6WYAwmSxv"},"slug":"taktarov","id":"16Bqoy65EZc6QC90ju3NKo"}],"video":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=2rh13TqNDF4","id":"3JX3slpC8cNDnWg4vJrwBY"},{"title":"Alexey Golubev — «Video content protection overview for Frontend developers»","shortTitle":"Video content protection overview for Frontend developers","description":"It is easy to embed video to your html page, but when it is necessary to playback protected video content things become more complex.\n\nDuring the presentation you will become familiar with the video content protection in general and how to implement playback of protected video content in different browsers.","persons":[{"name":"Алексей","lastname":"Голубев","photo":{"title":"Голубев","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/ej3wzulnf8dw/4Y1E3OGtR0kK8ZAH2BoqP5/94bdb2cbbf208340d27e62081eb9a06e/Alexey_Golubev.jpg","details":{"size":3182,"image":{"width":130,"height":130}},"fileName":"Alexey Golubev.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"},"id":"4Y1E3OGtR0kK8ZAH2BoqP5"},"slug":"golubev","id":"4JbmEAxXIMquz3hKlkZXHD"}],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXC4xuM1EH8","id":"2KcdsVpQFUSK5HZZQxGUAH"},{"title":"Alexander Korotaev — «WebGL and 2D: simple as Web»","shortTitle":"WebGL and 2D: simple as Web","description":"WebGL is a fastest rendering technology in web, but API looks to hard to learn. Standard already lives 9 years long but no big amount of real experts we have. I will show how to create 2D graphics in browser using React or Canvas to render it using WebGL.\n\nThis talk for developers who knows that WebGL is to fast, but do not know right way to reduce complexity and draw something except one triange from many examples from the google search results.","persons":[{"name":"Александр","lastname":"Коротаев","bio":"Организатор SPB Frontend.
